This is the core gameplay logic for Else Heart.Break(). I open sourced this to make it easier for people to make mods for the game.
To use the code in this repository or the mods made from it you must be an individual who owns a valid copy of Else Heart.Break(), bought via Steam, Humble or GOG.
If you want to do something else with the code, please ask for permission first.
